You can also find the full source code for the demo [here](./sample-code/). Note that this Xcode project connects to the API key for my demo RevenueCat project. To manipulate the offering metatadata json file for yourself, you can create your own [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) project and set your offering metadata to the example [json file](./sample-code/Backend%20Driven%20Paywalls%20Demo/Backend%20Driven%20Paywalls%20Demo/paywall-metadata-example.json) in this project.
